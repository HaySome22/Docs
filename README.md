This is a userscript to help you use Fflogs better. You need a userscript extension to use it, like [Violentmonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/violentmonkey/jinjaccalgkegednnccohejagnlnfdag?hl=en). Navigate to the script URL after installing the extension and it will prompt you to install the script.

(Buttons from right to left)

## 1) Xiva

- Convenience button to navigate from a log to its Xiva link
- Left click to use the same tab or middle click to use a new tab
- Pre-select a character on Fflogs to skip character select on Xiva.

## 2) Time Diff

 - On any "events" page containing timestamps, add a column that shows
   the time diff from row to row
- A common use case is to open a character's cast event timeline and see the time taken for oGCD weaves
- This can be further used to dial in a "late weave" timing

## 3) Filter GCDs

- Show only GCDs
- Common use cases: see cast event timeline of only GCDs, see cast table of only GCDs

## 4) LB Events

- Show LB events and the diff from row to row
- Natural LB tick diff is not shown (170 for duplicate comp, 220 for normal)
- A diff of 300 or 600 indicates LB gen

## 5) Target Times

- Show events for when the boss is targetable & untargetable
- FYI, pull time depends on ping; good pull times are 135ms for east coast and 90ms for west coast
- Check out macro pulling in Discord to consistently pull as fast as your ping allows

## 6) Filter Time 

Accurately filter a time range. Say you want to filter up to 6:00 but mousing the graph only lets you pick 5:59 or 6:01. To use this button, drag a time range from 0:00 to any time, then click the button to specify the end time.

## Other Stuff

If a foreign language log is detected, automatically redirect to the translated log. This only applies on rank pages where logs have a data center specified.
